# WebEyeTrack in Python

# Intro

# Installation & Dependencies

For the following repo, make sure to use Tensorflow/Keras 2.x and not the latest Tensorflow/Keras 3.x since the latest version of Keras isn't fully support in TensorflowJS and results in issues using the required ``LayersModel`` for on-device model adaptation.

Tested setup: 
* Ubuntu 24.04
* Python 3.10
* Tensorflow 2.11.1
* TensorflowJS 3.21.0

Aside from this warning, run the following command to install the ``webeyetrack`` package

```
git clone https://github.com/redforestai/webeyetrack
cd python
pip install .
```

# Demo
